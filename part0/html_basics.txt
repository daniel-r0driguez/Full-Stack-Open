HTML Basics
===========

- HTML = Hypertext Markup Language is the code used to structure a web page and its content.
- HTML consists of a series of elements, which you can enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to makie it appear a certain way, or act a certain way.
- <p>Text here...</p> is a paragraph element.
- Every element can also have attributes.
- Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content.
- Simple attribute values that don't contain ASCII whitespace (or any of the characters " ' ` = < >) can remain unquoted, but it is recommended that you quote all attribute values, as it makes the code more consistent and understandable.
- You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called nesting.
- Some elements have no content and are called void elements (example <img></img> tags).

Anatomy of an HTML document
----------------------------
- <!DOCTYPE html> — doctype. It is a required preamble. In the mists of time, when HTML was young (around 1991/92), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML, which could mean automatic error checking and other useful things. However, these days, they don't do much and are basically just needed to make sure your document behaves correctly. That's all you need to know for now.

- <html></html> — the <html> element. This element wraps all the content on the entire page and is sometimes known as the root element. It also includes the lang attribute, setting the primary language of the document.

- <head></head> — the <head> element. This element acts as a container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page that isn't the content you are showing to your page's viewers. This includes things like keywords and a page description that you want to appear in search results, CSS to style our content, character set declarations, and more.

- <meta charset="utf-8"> — This element sets the character set your document should use to UTF-8 which includes most characters from the vast majority of written languages. Essentially, it can now handle any textual content you might put on it. There is no reason not to set this, and it can help avoid some problems later on.

- <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width"> — This viewport element ensures the page renders at the width of viewport, preventing mobile browsers from rendering pages wider than the viewport and then shrinking them down.

- <title></title> — the <title> element. This sets the title of your page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. It is also used to describe the page when you bookmark/favorite it.

- <body></body> — the <body> element. This contains all the content that you want to show to web users when they visit your page, whether that's text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.


Lists
---------
- Marking up lists always consists of at least 2 elements. The most common list types are ordered and unordered lists.
- Unordered lists are for lists where the order of the items doesn't matter, such as a shopping list. These are wrapped in a <ul> element.
- Ordered lists are for lists where the order of the items does matter, such as a recipe. These are wrapped in an <ol> element.
- Each item inside the lists is put inside an <li> (list item) element.

Links
--------
- To add a link, we need to use a simple element — <a> — "a" being the short form for "anchor".
1. Choose some text. We chose the text "Mozilla Manifesto".
2. Wrap the text in an <a> element.
3. Give the <a> element an href attribute.
4. Fill in the value of this attribute with the web address that you want the link to.
- href stands for hypertext reference
